# Ratatui Music Player (Rust)

## Name and project goals are meant to mirror ncmpcpp

### rmpr goals

I like ncmpcpp, but its customizability and overall apperance left much to be desired. 
This project is meant to be both a learning expirience for myself and an attempt to make
a music player with features and abilities similar to those of ncmpcpp.

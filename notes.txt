TUI
	1. Display metadata in top block
	2. Display queue info in right block
	3. FIX ALL THE BUGS!!!!!
		1. Clearing after a speed-up song is finished doesn't work (or maybe when a song is done without any speed changes? I don't know. Need to test)
	4. Add tick system to update display without user input
LOGIC
	1. Instead of metadata being given to the file browser and per-file, see if the data could be fetched from metadata_list in browser
	2. Make the play, queue, and skip code in event_handling functions and put the logic somewhere else

1. Add block to bottom of screen and display file metadata
2. Instead of metadata being given to the file browser and per-file (tui.rs:226:227), see if the data could be gotten from metadata_list in browser
3. Make sink_handling::sink_pos return an Option<String> for better tui displaying (may not be needed)

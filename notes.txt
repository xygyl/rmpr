1. Add block to bottom of screen and display file metadata
2. Rework bottom_center elements so that the unwrap_or_else is in the main struct impl rather than the tui code (like duration_as_string)
3. Instead of metadata being given to the file browser and per-file (tui.rs:226:227), see if the data could be gotten from metadata_list in browser
4. Add keybind to go to directory of curretnly playing song. If no song is playing then do nothing
5. Make sink_handling::sink_pos return an Option<String> for better tui displaying
6. Add key for appending to sink and for changing the currently playing song without skipping (old behavior)
7. BUG: enter to play a song, a to queue another one, enter on another song, s to skip. queued song doesn't play.

TUI
	1. Add block to top of screen to display file metadata
	2. Add block to bottom of screen to display seekbar

LOGIC
	1. Instead of metadata being given to the file browser and per-file, see if the data could be fetched from metadata_list in browser
	2. Make the play, queue, and skip code in event_handling functions and put the logic somewhere else
